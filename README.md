# Bash programming

Here you can find some programming samples for the born again shell. You can find the tutorials on my channel, too, which are in German, however, the programming itself contains the English written implementation.

### Can I use this code samples?
Of course, you can.

### Are these compatible with sh, ksh, csh, ...?
It depends on the system. Some code could not run on sh, ksh, csh, ...

### On which operating system were these scrips made?
Linux Mint 19

### Which editor shall be used?
It depends on you. These scripts were written with the terminal editor nano. You can also use any other editor.

Finally, if you've questions, wishes or else, then contact me.

Have fun!
